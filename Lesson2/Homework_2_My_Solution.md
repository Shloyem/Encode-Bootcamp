2. In case we are not talking about the Null address - 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -
(Holding 172B usd worth of tokens. This address is not owned by any user, is often associated with token burn & mint/genesis events and used as a generic null address)
It would be from this list:
https://etherscan.io/accounts
0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa	Beacon Deposit Contract	14,378,135.00771856 Ether


3. 
- i. Seems to be Vitalik Buterin second address:
1st: 0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b
2nd: 0x1db3439a222c519ab44bb1144fc28167b4fa6ee6

- ii. This address is commonly used by projects to burn tokens (reducing total supply).
This address is not owned by any user, is often associated with token burn & mint/genesis events and used as a generic null address.

4. Done!
